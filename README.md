# EN-PH-131

This repository contains completed laboratory work for **EN PH 131** at the University of Alberta. It provides a complete academic record of experimental procedures, data collection, analysis, uncertainty evaluation, and final reporting for all required engineering physics laboratories.

## Contents

### Laboratory Reports
- **Lab 1 – Lab 5**  
  Full laboratory reports submitted for each experiment, provided in multiple formats:
  - `.docx` for editable source files
  - `.pdf` for final submitted versions
  - `.xlsx` for raw data, calculations, and plots

### Figures, Media, and Data Capture
- **Images and Screenshots**  
  Experimental setups, Logger Pro outputs, graphs, and supporting visuals referenced in lab reports.
- **Video Files**  
  Recorded experimental footage used for motion analysis and data extraction.

### Reference and Comparison Material
- **Peer Sample**  
  A reference lab report used for comparison and verification during report preparation.

## Learning Outcomes Demonstrated
- Experimental measurement and instrumentation  
- Data analysis and graphical interpretation  
- Uncertainty analysis and error propagation  
- Technical and scientific report writing  
- Use of analysis tools such as spreadsheets and Logger Pro  

## Notes
- Files are preserved in their original submitted formats.
- Spreadsheet files contain raw measurements, intermediate calculations, and final results.
- Media files support experimental observations and analysis described in the reports.
- This repository serves as an academic record rather than a tutorial or solution guide.
